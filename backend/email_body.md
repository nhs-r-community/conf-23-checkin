### Social Programme

We have opted not to arrange any formal social events this year, but invite anyone to post on the #conference Slack channel if you want to propose a meet up at a particular place and time.

Some of the Strategy Unit Data Science team will be heading to [The Market Halls](https://markethalls.co.uk/) for food on Thursday evening, then to [NQ64](https://nq64.co.uk/soho/) for some retro gaming fun afterwards. If you'd like to join us, message Tom Jemmett on Slack! NB we are not planning on booking tables, so the venue may not be able to accommodate everyone if lots of people join, but there are plenty of other restaurants around!
